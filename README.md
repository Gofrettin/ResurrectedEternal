# Updating Offsets
Inside GenericObjects folder you can find the equivalent file for updating the offsets.
The only one you really need to update is the dwGetAllClasses offset since the signature scanner cant find it.

# Updating Signatures
If a signature breaks you can update the ./configs/signatures.json file or update the sigs inside the Generators.cs and delete the signatures.json.

## tl:dr
