### Updating Offsets
~~Inside GenericObjects folder you can find the "equivalent" file for updating the offsets.<br>
The only one you really need to update is the <strong>dwGetAllClasses</strong> offset since the signature scanner cant find it.<br>~~
A couple of offsets can be found inside various components. Most prevailant in SkillModNeon.cs
<br>

### Updating Signatures
All necessary signatures are included and the hack should work until the next signature breaking update.<br>
If a signature breaks you can update the ./configs/signatures.json file or update the sigs inside the Generators.cs and delete the signatures.json. <br>
Please refer to the hazedumper signatures if you need to do that.<br>https://github.com/frk1/hazedumper/blob/master/config.json
