# VAC Proof?
Using the "unchanged" compiled assembly might or might not become detected in the future.<br> So the current status is: <strong><em>Use at own Risk</em></strong><br>
To get a <strong>version that is proof until the end of time</strong> (or if VAC releases a heavy update),<br> download a compiled assembly from our project page on rrcheats.eu


# Updating Offsets
Inside GenericObjects folder you can find the "equivalent" file for updating the offsets.<br>
The only one you really need to update is the <strong>dwGetAllClasses</strong> offset since the signature scanner cant find it.<br>
<br>

# Updating Signatures
If a signature breaks you can update the ./configs/signatures.json file or update the sigs inside the Generators.cs and delete the signatures.json. <br>Please refer to the hazedumper signatures if you need to do that.<br>https://github.com/frk1/hazedumper/blob/master/config.json
