# Updating Offsets
Inside GenericObjects folder you can find the "equivalent" file for updating the offsets.<br>
The only one you really need to update is the <strong>dwGetAllClasses</strong> offset since the signature scanner cant find it.<br>
<br>
# Updating Signatures
If a signature breaks you can update the ./configs/signatures.json file or update the sigs inside the Generators.cs and delete the signatures.json. <br>Please refer to the hazedumper signatures if you need to do that.<br>https://github.com/frk1/hazedumper/blob/master/config.json
